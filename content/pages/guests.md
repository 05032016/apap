	    <p>Maria Luisa Chiofalo graduated in physics at the University of Pisa in 1992 and she is Associate Professor of Condensed Matter in the same university since 2007. Her main research topics are: high-temperature superconductivity; quantum degenerate Fermi and Bose atomic gases with tunable interactions and density and spin effects, also in reduced dimensions; application of the physics of quantum degenerate gases to fundamental physics and to technological devices.</br>
	    She conceived and participated to several popular science activities and festival, including national TV and radio programs. <br/>
	    She is also co-founder of the MAMI- Pisa, Italian expression of the UNICEF World Alliance for Breastfeeding Actions and Member of the Italian Association of Women and Science and of the network Women for Intelligent and Smart TERritories.</br>
	      Maria Luisa Chiofalo has a long experience in institutional, political and administration activities. Since May 2008 she has been asked by the Pisa mayor Marco Filippeschi as councilor with competences on educational policies, promotion of digital technologies for education, gender policies, citizenship values and culture of legality. This appointment has been renovated in 2013, adding the competences on scientific education and initiatives to contrast corruption in the Public Administration.</p>

	    <p>Massimo Inguscio graduated in physics from the University of Pisa in 1972 and received his PhD from the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa in 1976. </br>
	A full Professor of Optics, Atomic Physics and Structure of Matter at the University of Naples (from 1986) and at the University of Florence (from 1991), he is co-founder of LENS, the European Laboratory for Nonlinear Spectroscopy, which he led as Director for 6 years (1998-2004).  He was also Director of the Department for Material and Devices (2009-2012) and of the Department for Sciences and Technologies of Matter (2012-2014) of the CNR, the Italian National Research Council.</br>
	  In 2014 Massimo Inguscio has been appointed President of the Italian National Institute for Metrological Research (INRIM). He is Fellow of the Accademia dei Lincei, the American Physical Society and the European Optical Society.  For the European Research Council (ERC) he was Chairman (2007-2010) and Member (2012 and 2014) of the Scientific Panel PE2 “Fundamental Constituents of Matter”. He received prizes, such as the Humboldt Research Award by the Humboldt Foundation (2004), the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences (2005) and the “Herbert Walther” Award (2014) of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft and of the Optical Society.</p>
